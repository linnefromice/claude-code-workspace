## User Customization

If a `CLAUDE.local.md` file exists in the root directory, read it and **prioritize its
instructions over this file**. This allows individual developers to customize AI behavior
without affecting team-shared rules.

Example use cases for `CLAUDE.local.md`:
- Personal coding style preferences
- Local environment-specific configurations
- Custom workflow instructions
- Development focus areas
